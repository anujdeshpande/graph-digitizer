===============

Octave functions to accept a line chart as input and return the plotted points 

*VERY VERY BETA*

Had to fetch SED(spectral energy distribution) graphs from a website
Script I used is here:
https://github.com/anujdeshpande/scripts/blob/master/fetch_sed.py

Needed the digitized graphs for post processing.
Used the functions herein for thickening, cropping, getting the co-ordinates and combining 2 (or more) graphs to get the co-ordinates of combined filters
